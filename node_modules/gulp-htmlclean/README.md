# gulp-htmlclean

This [gulp](http://gulpjs.com/) plugin is wrapper of [htmlclean](https://github.com/anseki/htmlclean).

* [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) plugin: [grunt-htmlclean](https://github.com/anseki/grunt-htmlclean)

**If you want to just clean files, [Command Line Tool](https://github.com/anseki/htmlclean) is easy way.**

Simple and lightweight cleaner that just removes whitespaces, comments, etc. to minify HTML/SVG.  
This differs from others in that this removes whitespaces, line-breaks, etc. as much as possible.

## Removing
htmlclean removes the following texts.

+ The leading whitespaces, tabs and line-breaks, and the trailing whitespaces, tabs and line-breaks.
+ The unneeded whitespaces, tabs and line-breaks between HTML/SVG tags.
+ The more than two whitespaces, tabs and line-breaks (suppressed to one space).
+ HTML/SVG comments.

The more than two whitespaces (even if those are divided by HTML/SVG tags) in a line are suppressed.

**Example:**

Before

```html
<p>The <strong> clean <span> <em> HTML is here. </em> </span> </strong> </p>
```

After

```html
<p>The <strong>clean <span><em>HTML is here.</em></span></strong></p>
```

The whitespace that was right side of `<strong>` was removed, and the left side was kept.  
The both side whitespaces of `<em>` were removed.

## Protecting
The following texts are protected (excluded from removing).

+ The texts in `textarea`, `script` and `style` elements, and text nodes in `pre` elements.
+ The quoted texts in tag attribute.
+ The texts in SSI tags (PHP, JSP, ASP/ASP.NET and Apache SSI).
+ IE conditional comments. e.g. `<!--[if lt IE 7]>`
+ The texts between `<!--[htmlclean-protect]-->` and `<!--[/htmlclean-protect]-->`.
+ The texts that is matched by `protect` option (see "Options").
